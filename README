FUEL, Factor's Ultimate Emacs Library                              -*- org -*-
-------------------------------------

FUEL provides a complete environment for your Factor coding pleasure
inside Emacs, including source code edition and interaction with a
Factor listener instance running within Emacs.

FUEL was started by Jose A Ortega as an extension to Eduardo Cavazos'
original factor.el code. Eduardo is also responsible of naming the
beast.

* Installation

  FUEL comes bundled with Factor's distribution. The folder misc/fuel
  contains Elisp code, and there's a fuel vocabulary in extras/fuel.

  To install FUEL, either add this line to your Emacs initialisation:

  (load-file "<path/to/factor/installation>/misc/fuel/fu.el")

  or

  (add-to-list load-path "<path/to/factor/installation>/fuel")
  (require 'fuel)

  If all you want is a major mode for editing Factor code with pretty
  font colors and indentation, without running the factor listener
  inside Emacs, you can use instead:

  (add-to-list load-path "<path/to/factor/installation>/fuel")
  (setq factor-mode-use-fuel nil)
  (require 'factor-mode)

* Basic usage
*** Running the listener

  If you're using the default factor binary and images locations inside
  the Factor's source tree, that should be enough to start using FUEL.
  Editing any file with the extension .factor will put you in
  factor-mode; try C-hm for a summary of available commands.

  To start the listener, try M-x run-factor.

  By default, FUEL will try to use the binary and image files in the
  factor installation directory. You can customize them with:

    (setq fuel-listener-factor-binary <full path to factor>)
    (setq fuel-listener-factor-image <full path to factor image>)

  Many aspects of the environment can be customized:
  M-x customize-group fuel will show you how many.

*** Faster listener startup

  On startup, run-factor loads the fuel vocabulary, which can take a
  while. If you want to speedup the load process, type 'save' in the
  listener prompt just after invoking run-factor. This will save a
  factor image (overwriting the current one) with all the needed
  vocabs.

*** Vocabulary creation

    FUEL offers a basic interface with Factor's scaffolding utilities.
    To create a new vocabulary directory and associated files:

       M-x fuel-scaffold-vocab

    and when in a vocab file, to create a docs file with boilerplate
    for each word:

       M-x fuel-scaffold-help

* Quick key reference

  (Triple chords ending in a single letter <x> accept also C-<x> (e.g.
  C-cC-eC-r is the same as C-cC-er)).

*** In factor source files:

    - C-cz : switch to listener

    - C-cr, C-cC-er : eval region
    - C-M-r, C-cC-ee : eval region, extending it to definition boundaries
    - C-M-x, C-cC-ex : eval definition around point
    - C-ck, C-cC-ek : run file

    - C-cC-da : toggle autodoc mode
    - C-cC-dd : help for word at point
    - C-cC-ds : short help word at point
    - C-cC-de : show stack effect of current sexp (with prefix, region)
    - C-cC-dp : find words containing given substring (M-x fuel-apropos)
    - C-cC-dv : show words in current file (with prefix, ask for vocab)

    - C-cM-<, C-cC-d< : show callers of word at point
    - C-cM->, C-cC-d> : show callees of word at point

    - C-cC-xs : extract innermost sexp (up to point)  as a separate word
    - C-cC-xr : extract region as a separate word
    - C-cC-xi : replace word at point by its definition
    - C-cC-xv : extract region as a separate vocabulary

*** In the listener:

    - TAB : complete word at point
    - M-. : edit word at point in Emacs
    - C-ca : toggle autodoc mode
    - C-cp : find words containing given substring (M-x fuel-apropos)
    - C-cs : toggle stack mode
    - C-cv : edit vocabulary
    - C-ch : help for word at point
    - C-ck : run file

*** In the debugger (it pops up upon eval/compilation errors):

    - g : go to error
    - <digit> : invoke nth restart
    - w/e/l : invoke :warnings, :errors, :linkage
    - q : bury buffer
